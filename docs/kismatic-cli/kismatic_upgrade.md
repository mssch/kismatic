## kismatic upgrade

Upgrade your Kubernetes cluster

### Synopsis


Upgrade your Kubernetes cluster.

The upgrade process is applied to each node, one node at a time. If a private docker registry
is being used, the new container images will be pushed by Kismatic before starting to upgrade
nodes.

Nodes in the cluster are upgraded in the following order:

1. Etcd nodes
2. Master nodes
3. Worker nodes (regardless of specialization)


```
kismatic upgrade
