## kismatic upgrade offline

Perform an offline upgrade of your Kubernetes cluster

### Synopsis


Perform an offline upgrade of your Kubernetes cluster.

The offline upgrade is available for those clusters in which safety and availabilty are not a concern.
In this mode, the safety and availability checks will not be performed, nor will the nodes in the cluster
be drained of workloads.

Performing an offline upgrade could result in loss of critical data and reduced service
availability. For this reason, this method should not be used for clusters that are housing
production workloads.
