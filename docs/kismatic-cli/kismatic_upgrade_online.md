## kismatic upgrade online

Perform an online upgrade of your Kubernetes cluster

### Synopsis


Perform an online upgrade of your Kubernetes cluster.

During an online upgrade, Kismatic will run safety and availability checks (see table below) against the
existing cluster before performing the upgrade. If any unsafe condition is detected, a report will
be printed, and the upgrade will not proceed.

If the node under upgrade is a Kubernetes node, it is cordoned and drained of workloads
before any changes are applied.
